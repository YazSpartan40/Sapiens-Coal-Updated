## Overview
The Charcoal mod introduces efficient charcoal fuel production to Sapiens! Transform wood into superior charcoal fuel that burns 5x longer than regular branches, making it perfect for extended cooking, smelting, and heating sessions.

## Features

### 🔥 Superior Fuel
- **Charcoal burns 5x longer** than branches (5 fuel units vs 1)
- Works in **campfires, kilns, and all fuel-consuming objects**
- More efficient than logs for long-term fuel needs

### 🛠️ Crafting Recipes
- **3 Branches → 2 Charcoal** (333% fuel efficiency gain!)
- **1 Log → 2 Charcoal** (67% fuel efficiency gain)
- Craftable at both **campfires AND kilns**

### 🔬 Research System
- **Charcoal Making research** unlocks after learning campfire cooking
- Craft any charcoal recipe to discover the technique
- All recipes become available permanently

## How to Use

1. **Learn Campfire Cooking** skill (required prerequisite)
2. **Gather branches or logs** from trees
3. **Approach a campfire or kiln** and open the crafting menu
4. **Select a charcoal recipe** and craft it
5. **Use the resulting charcoal** as fuel in any fire-based object

## Fuel Efficiency Comparison

| Fuel Type | Fuel Value | Efficiency Notes |
|-----------|------------|------------------|
| Branch | 1 | Basic fuel |
| Log | 6 | Good for large fires |
| **Charcoal** | **5** | Superior for long burns |
